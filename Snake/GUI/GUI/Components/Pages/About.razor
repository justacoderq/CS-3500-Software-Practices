        <h2 style="color: #FF9800;">🧩 What Our Game Is About</h2>
        <p>Our Snake Game revolves around classic gameplay with a modern twist:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>🐍 Control your snake, slither through the world, and collect powerups to grow longer.</li>
            <li>🧱 Snakes cannot pass through walls. If they try, it’s game over for them!</li>
            <li>🌍 Edge-of-the-world behavior is undefined unless surrounded by walls.</li>
            <li>🍎 Powerups increase the snake's length by a fixed amount, encouraging strategic play.</li>
            <li>☠️ Crashing into walls or other snakes results in respawning with a shorter snake after a delay.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 style="color: #2196F3;">🎨 How It Looks</h2>
        <p>Our game’s visual design is simple yet effective, with attention to clarity and usability:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Snakes are colorful, smooth lines with a 10-pixel stroke width for visibility.</li>
            <li>Powerups are bright red squares with yellow borders, sized at 16x16 pixels.</li>
            <li>Walls are solid blocks, rendered as 50x50 pixel segments to create obstacles.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>🎯 To keep gameplay focused, your snake is always centered on the canvas for smooth and intuitive navigation.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #F44336;">🌍 World-Space vs. Image-Space</h2>
        <p>
            Our game balances two spaces:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>World-Space: The center of the game world is at (0, 0), with coordinates extending from <code>-worldSize / 2</code> to <code>+worldSize / 2</code>.</li>
            <li>Image-Space: The top-left corner of the screen is (0, 0). We dynamically adjust the canvas so your snake stays centered, even in large worlds.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This ensures consistency and immersion, no matter where you move.</p>

        <h2 style="color: #673AB7;">🛠️ How We Built the Game</h2>
        <p>We structured our game using three main components:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Model:</strong> Tracks all in-game entities, including snakes, walls, powerups, and the world size.</li>
            <li><strong>Controller:</strong> Handles server communication, processes player inputs, and updates the model.</li>
            <li><strong>View:</strong> Renders the game world using <code>Blazor.Extensions.Canvas</code>, ensuring a polished and engaging interface.</li>
        </ul>
