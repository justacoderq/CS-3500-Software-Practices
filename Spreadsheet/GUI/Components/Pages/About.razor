<h1>About the Spreadsheet Application</h1>

<p>Welcome to the Spreadsheet Application! This tool is designed to facilitate data management and manipulation through an easy-to-use interface. Below is a guide on how to effectively use the application.</p>

<h2>Core Functionality</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Content Field Setting:</strong> Users can input data into a content field that directly corresponds to each cell in the spreadsheet. This allows for dynamic editing of cell values.</li>
	<li><strong>Cell Value and Name Management:</strong> Each cell can be assigned a name (e.g., A1, B1) and a value (e.g., 10, "Hello"). This structure facilitates easy reference and retrieval of data.</li>
	<li><strong>Save and Load Functionality:</strong> Users can save their spreadsheet data to a file and later load it back into the application. This feature ensures that users can work on their spreadsheets over multiple sessions without losing their data.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Additional Features</h2>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Enter Key Functionality:</strong> Pressing the "Enter" key allows users to quickly save changes made to a cell and move focus to the cell below. This enhances the user experience by facilitating fast navigation and efficient data entry.</li>
	<li><strong>Color Coding:</strong> Cells can be color-coded based on their content: if you enter a formula, the cell will be highlighted in yellow; double values will be highlighted in green; and string values will be highlighted in red. This visual aid helps users quickly identify important data or trends at a glance.</li>
	<li><strong>Dark Mode:</strong> A dark mode feature has been implemented, allowing users to switch to a darker color scheme for a more comfortable viewing experience in low-light environments. This includes changing the background color of the table and headers, as well as adjusting the text color for better contrast.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear Cell Button:</strong> A button is provided to clear the content of the currently selected cell, allowing users to quickly remove unwanted data.</li>
	<li><strong>Clear All Cells Button:</strong> An additional button allows users to clear all cells in the spreadsheet at once, which is useful for resetting the spreadsheet or starting fresh.</li>
</ul>
